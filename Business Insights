1. Profitability by Selling Price
Insight: As the selling price increases, the profit percentage also tends to increase. However, there might be price points where the profit margin drops, indicating inefficient pricing.
Action: Identify optimal pricing strategies to maximize profit while maintaining competitive pricing.
2. Cost Breakdown and Impact on Profitability
Insight: If packaging or ingredient costs are significantly high, they could be cutting into profit margins.
Action: Negotiate better deals with suppliers, consider alternative packaging, or optimize ingredient use.
3. Predicted vs. Actual Profit Accuracy
Insight: If the predicted profit percentage closely matches the actual profit percentage, the model is reliable. However, large deviations may indicate missing factors (e.g., discounts, waste, seasonal demand).
Action: Refine the prediction model by including additional variables like seasonal demand fluctuations or special promotions.
4. Revenue vs. Cost Comparison
Insight: If revenue is not significantly exceeding costs, the business may need to adjust pricing, reduce costs, or increase volume.
Action: Focus on high-margin products and adjust pricing for low-margin items.
5. Error Analysis & Model Improvement
Insight: If certain selling prices consistently show higher prediction errors, the model might be struggling to account for unknown factors like discounts, customer preferences, or operational inefficiencies.
Action: Collect more data on external influences like seasonal trends and refine the ML model
